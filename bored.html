        <p>This is a short introduction of myself. Prior to attending this school,
                I actually worked on unmanned air systems. Before that, I was a United States soldier.
                So I'm excited to learn all I can.</p><br>

        <p>My objectives while I attend this school are as follows:<br>
                <br>
                <br>1. Design and complete robotic and embedded systems solutions that address real-world
                situations and challenges
